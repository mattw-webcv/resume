# Open Source Synthesised License (OSSL) — v1.0 — July 2025

# Preamble

This document establishes the _Open Source Synthesised License_ (“OSSL”), a modular licensing framework designed to promote clarity, flexibility, and user freedom for creators, contributors, and users of licensed works.

_OSSL_ acknowledges and responds to the diverse and sometimes confusing landscape of licensing: from the overwhelming number of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) licences — whose subtle distinctions can quickly confuse users and impede decision-making — to the sometimes sweeping, unilateral, and restrictive corporate licences commonly employed by larger entities. While all licences necessarily impose some level of restriction on the licensed Work, some rely on language that is overly broad, unnecessarily verbose, technically opaque, vague, or otherwise inaccessible to most readers.

OSSL is conceptually grounded in the _FOSS_ model and framework — which espouses freedom to access, use, modify, and redistribute FOSS–licensed works. This licence is structured for convenience and ease to minimise the learning curve for protecting your work.
This licence does not assume a single set of rules is appropriate for all contexts.

Instead, it provides foundational conditions alongside clearly defined optional modules (“Options”), which can be combined in transparent and deliberate ways to suit specific needs.
This dual nature — as both a fully functional licence and a customisable template — is intended to preserve transparency and simplicity without sacrificing flexibility or clarity.

Each Option is clearly defined and assigned a unique identifying code, which can be appended to the licence name or identifier accompanying the Licensed Work. This enables Licensors to explicitly communicate the specific rights, conditions, permissions, and obligations that apply to their work in a way that is clear to both human and legal readers.

# Terms

For the purposes of this licence, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below. Defined terms appear capitalised throughout this document. Unless otherwise specified, singular terms include the plural, and vice versa.

1. **“Licensed Work”** — The original work of authorship, including any accompanying documentation, code, media, or other material, made available by the Licensor under this licence.

2. **“Licensor”** — The individual or legal entity who authors, owns, or otherwise has the legal right to licence the Licensed Work and who offers it under the terms of this licence.

3. **“Licensee”** — Any individual or legal entity who obtains, uses, modifies, distributes, or otherwise exercises rights in the Licensed Work under the terms of this licence. Where applicable, “You” refers to the Licensee.

4. **“Derivative Work”** — Any work that is based upon, incorporates, or adapts the Licensed Work, in whole or in part, including but not limited to modifications, translations, adaptations, compilations, or collective works, as defined under applicable copyright law.

5. **“Option”** — An optional, modular clause that supplements or modifies the foundational terms of this licence. Each Option is identified by a unique code (“Option Code”), which may be appended to the licence name or identifier to indicate the specific combination of Options selected by the Licensor.

6. **“Option Code”** — A unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to a specific Option, used to denote the inclusion of that Option in the applicable licence configuration.

7. **“Use”** — Any act that exercises a right granted by this licence with respect to the Licensed Work, including but not limited to running, displaying, performing, copying, modifying, distributing, or creating a Derivative Work of the Licensed Work.

8. **“Your Company”** — Any legal entity, sole proprietorship, partnership, or other organisational body that employs or contracts the Licensee, as well as any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate entities that directly or indirectly control, are controlled by, or are under common control with such organisation.

9. **“Transparent Document”** — A copy of the licence presented in clear, plain, and accessible language and format, readable and interpretable by both human users and automated systems, and suitable for reproduction and distribution without technical or legal barriers.

10. **“Copyleft”** — A licensing principle under which Licensees who create and distribute Derivative Works are obligated to make such works available under the same licence terms as the Licensed Work, thereby preserving the freedoms originally granted.

11. **“Commercial Use”** — Any Use of the Licensed Work intended for or directed toward commercial advantage, monetary compensation, financial gain, or other consideration of material value.

12. **“Non-Commercial Use”** — Any Use of the Licensed Work that is neither intended for nor directed toward Commercial Use, including but not limited to personal study, research, hobbyist projects, educational purposes, and other activities without a profit-making intent.

13. **“Patent Claim”** — Any assertion by a Licensee or their Company that the Licensed Work or its Use infringes one or more claims of a patent owned or controlled by the Licensee or their Company.

14. **“Trademark”** — Any trademarks, service marks, trade names, or similar designations associated with the Licensor or the Licensed Work.
