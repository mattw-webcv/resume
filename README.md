This is my resume, Matt Williams.
I'll occasionally update this space.
Once I am comfortable with the layout, I will leave it be.
Big iteration changes will happen once I am ready to implement a php or laravel system- which is beyond the scope of a free simple html+css website.

The colour scheme I chose is based off the nord palette. Chosen for accessability and gentle tones.
