            <h3>Transferrable skills</h3>
            <p>
              This came from the simple recognition around playing chess. I
              wanted to pick hobbies, right down to my entertainment; that would
              teach me something I can transfer as much as possible.

            <h3>Adaptability</h3>
            <p>
              I'd realised knowledge is an accumulation of grasped
              opportunities; which means first age does not necessitate wisdom,
              and knowledge can get obseleted quickly. Biology isn't fixed, it
              changes and adapts based on use, or lack of. Cognition is also
              biology.

          <div>
            <h3>Time is short</h3>
            <p>
              I have about 10 hours a day for life; after travel, preparation
              for things, and sleeping. Within that 10 hours I need to balance
              learning, anticipating retirement, and enjoyment.

            <h3>Awareness</h3>
            <p>
              So much of our lives are spent ignorant of our unconscious and
              subconscious choices. A person can only consciously change what
              they're consciously aware. Understanding is the foundation of
              solution.

            <h3>Self imposed learning models</h3>
            <p>
              All my learning has been self-directed. Right down to searching,
              navigating, evaluating, and choosing material to learn from.
            </p>

          <h3>As of ~October 2023</h3>
          <p>
            Begin active learning of website design
            <br />
            Learning the full list of what I needed to learn.
            <br />
            Beginning with CCNA. Then recognising a website resume made with
            only an IDE text editor, from self paced learning is the simplest
            and fastest way of showing my capability.
            <br />
            <br />
            From website design, content, frameworks, and everything inbetween.
            <br />
            Html, php, css, laravel, rust, mariadb, nginx,
            <br />
            Hosting a website on the internet/cloud, setting up a business for
            income and tax. Purchasing domain name, business trading name,
            leasing server space.
            <br />
            <br />
            Sequenced and structured my learning, not to minimise my time to be
            'up and running'. But instead, to minimise 'total time taken'; for
            example, learning to make a website doesn't need to involve the
            arduous and tedious process of databases, and complicated full
            featured frameworks such as laravel. However constantly 'revisiting
            basics' to learn new components such as databases creates
            exponential overhead, overlap, in addition to simply repetition.

            <br />
            Wanting to be self sufficient conversation with anyone about
            anything protect against being manipulated and scammed understand
            how everything works.
